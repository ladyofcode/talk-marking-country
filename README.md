# talk-marking-country
The site used for my Marking Country talk. Apparently I like to make more work for myself instead of just using slides.

## Notes

- You may copy code, but not the assets in the assets folder.

- This site uses club GSAP (paid) plugins to function. You'll need to look into those if you want to replicate some of the effects.

- Don't expect mobile responsiveness. I didn't bother.

- Alternatives may exist depending on what you are trying to accomplish.

- If you watched my talk - thanks! ðŸ’–
